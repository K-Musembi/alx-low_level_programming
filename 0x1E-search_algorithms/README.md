Search Algorithms

Linear Search - sequential search algorithm through a list of items to find a value that matches the key.
Binary Search - performed on a sorted list of items by repeatedly dividing the interval in half until the key is found.

0-linear.c - function to perform linear search.
1-binary.c - function to perform binary search.
2-0 - time complexity of linear search.
3-0 - space complexity of linear search.
4-0 - time complexity of binary search.
5-0 - space complexity of binary search.
6-0 - space complexity of algorithm.
